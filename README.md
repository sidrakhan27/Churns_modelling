# Churns_modelling
The churnmodelling dataset contains information about customers of a bank, including demographic information, account information, and customer behavior. The dataset includes 10,000 records and 14 variables. The variables include the customer's credit score, geography, gender, age, tenure, balance, number of products held, whether or not the customer has a credit card, whether or not the customer is an active member, estimated salary, and whether or not the customer churned (left the bank).

The dataset was used to create a project that predicts customer churn using five different machine learning algorithms: Artificial Neural Network, DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and Support Vector Machine. The project achieved accuracy scores ranging from 79% to 86% using these algorithms.

This dataset can be used to study customer churn behavior in the banking industry and to develop predictive models for customer churn.

The churnmodelling dataset aims to solve the problem of predicting customer churn in a bank. Customer churn is when a customer stops using a company's services or products. In the context of a bank, churn occurs when a customer closes their account or stops using the bank's services. Predicting churn can help banks take proactive measures to retain customers and prevent loss of revenue. The churnmodelling dataset includes various customer attributes, such as age, credit score, balance, and tenure, as well as information on whether the customer churned or not

The churn modeling dataset was analyzed using several classification techniques to predict customer churn. These techniques included artificial neural network, decision tree classifier, random forest classifier, gradient boosting classifier, and support vector machine. The models were trained on a subset of the data and tested on a separate validation set to ensure accuracy. The best performing models were the artificial neural network, random forest classifier, gradient boosting classifier, and support vector machine, all achieving an accuracy of 86%. The decision tree classifier had a slightly lower accuracy of 79%.
